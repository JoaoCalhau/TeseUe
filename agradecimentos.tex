\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to start by thanking my parents for their support over these five years of university and to thank my girlfriend, Flávia, for being there for me during the last two years as well.

I thank my supervisors, Prof. Salvador Abreu and Major Nuno Goes, because without them this dissertation would not be possible, and Prof. Pedro Salgueiro for guiding me through all the work done during this year and for being there to provide me with new thoughts and encouraging me to take new steps. I also thank him for reviewing every single paper written during this work and for reviewing the dissertation, both in the initial and final phases. Without him this dissertation would be impossible to read and hard to understand.

I would like to acknowledge Departamento de Informática of Universidade de Évora for providing me, and my colleagues, excellent conditions to work in. And finally I would like to thank all my friends for being there for me and for helping me on many occasions.
