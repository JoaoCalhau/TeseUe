\begin{tueABSTRACT}
In this dissertation we present a new and innovative approach to Digital Forensics analysis, based on Declarative Programming approaches, more specifically Constraint Programming methodologies, to describe and solve Digital Forensics problems. With this approach we allow for an intuitive, descriptive and more efficient method to analyze digital equipment data.

The work described herein enables the description of a \acf{DFP} as a \acf{CSP} and, with the help of a \ac{CSP} solver, reach a solution to such problem, if it exists, which can be a set of elements or evidences that match the initial problem description.
