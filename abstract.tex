\begin{tueABSTRACT}
In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to Digital Forensics analysis, based on Declarative Programming approaches, more specifically Constraint Programming methodologies to describe and solve Digital Forensics problems. With this approach we allow for an intuitive, descriptive and more efficient method to analyze digital equipment data.
The work described herein allows the description of a Digital Forensics problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), and, with the help of a CSP solver, reach a solution to such problem, if it exists: a set of elements/evidences that match the initial problem description.
